The performance levels are: Level 0: No AI, Level 1: Emerging, Level 2: Competent, Level 3: Expert, Level 4: Virtuoso, Level 5: Superhuman. Generality is either Narrow or General. The paper also mentions levels of autonomy: Level 1 is AI as a Tool, Level 2 is AI as a Consulant, Level 3 is AI as Collaborator, Level 4 is AI as an Expert, and Level 5 is AI as an Agent.",
        "rubric": "All of the performance levels should be defined (although it's fine if Level 0 is omitted, since that isn't really one of them), and the fact that generality is either narrow or general should also be mentioned. If the levels of autonomy are also mentioned, that's a bonus."

        "rubric": "A good answer specifies that current state of the art LLMs are Level 1 (Emerging) AGI systems. Whether this actually counts as true AGI or not is up for debate, and the paper suggests that 'real' AGI doesn't begin until Level 2 (Competent). So it would be fair to say that according to this categorization, we have not yet achieved AGI."

Principle 6: Focus on the Path to AGI, not a Single Endpoint.",

        "gt_answer": "The paper argues that autonomy is an important factor when considering AGI systems, but that is should be thought of distinct from performance and generality. The Levels of Autonomy defined in the paper are correlated with the Levels of AGI (which cover performance and generality), because higher levels of autonomy are “unlocked” by AGI capability progression. But that doesn't mean that a given system needs to be deployed at the highest level of autonomy it's capable of.",

        "gt_answer": "AlphaCodium is a new approach to code generation designed to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on code problems, particularly in the context of competitive programming. It operates through an iterative process that involves reasoning about the problem in natural language and then generating, running, and fixing solution code against a set of tests. The process is divided into two main phases: a pre-processing phase and a code iterations phase.\n\nThe flow stages of AlphaCodium are as follows:\n\n1. **Problem Reflection**: Describe the problem in bullet points, addressing the problem's goal, inputs, outputs, rules, constraints, and other relevant details from the problem description.\n\n2. **Public Tests Reasoning**: Explain why each test input leads to its corresponding output.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Solutions**: Generate a list of 2-3 possible solutions to the problem, described in natural language.\n\n4. **Rank Solutions**: Rank the possible solutions based on correctness, simplicity, and robustness, choosing the \"best solution\" rather than necessarily the most efficient one.\n\n5. **Generate Additional AI Tests**: Create an additional 6-8 diverse input-output tests for the problem that cover cases and aspects not addressed by the original public tests.\n\n6. **Initial Code Solution**: Generate an initial code solution that is reasonably close to the correct code. Run this code on selected public and AI tests, iterating until the tests pass or a try-limit is reached. The first code that passes the tests or the code with the closest output will be used as the base code for the next steps.\n\n7. **Iterate on Public Tests**: Start from the base code and iteratively run it on the public tests. If the code fails on a specific test, attempt to fix it based on the error message.\n\n8. **Iterate on AI-generated Tests**: Continue the run-fix iterations on the AI-generated tests, using \"test anchors\" to ensure that any code fixes do not break previously passed tests.",

        "query": "What dataset was used for evaluation in the AlphaCodium paper? Why was this dataset chosen?",
        "gt_answer": "The dataset used for evaluation in the AlphaCodium paper is the CodeContests dataset. This dataset was chosen for several reasons:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: CodeContests utilizes a comprehensive private set of tests to avoid false positives. Each problem in the dataset contains approximately 200 private input-output tests that the generated code solution must pass. This allows for a thorough evaluation of the code's correctness.\n\n2. **Attention to Detail**: The dataset is designed with complicated and lengthy problem descriptions that include small details and nuances. This challenges the language models to pay attention to critical minor details, which is essential for solving real-world code problems.\n\n3. **Realism**: The complexity and detailed nature of the problems in the CodeContests dataset simulate real-life coding problems, which often involve multiple factors and considerations. This contrasts with simpler code datasets where problems are presented more concisely and may not capture the complexity of real-world coding tasks.\n\n4. **Avoiding False Positives**: The use of a private test set helps in reducing the rate of false positives, ensuring that the solutions generated by the models are genuinely effective and not just seemingly correct based on a limited set of public tests.\n\nThe AlphaCodium paper emphasizes that utilizing harder and more complicated benchmarks like the CodeContests dataset allows the community to better evaluate large language models (LLMs) compared to more simplistic benchmarks that are common in the field.",

        "query": "Explain the soft decision with double validation concept from the AlphaCodium paper. How was this incorporated into the system?",
        "gt_answer": "The \"soft decision with double validation\" concept from the AlphaCodium paper refers to a method designed to improve the accuracy of code tasks performed by large language models (LLMs). This method addresses the issue where LLMs often struggle with tasks that require strict, non-trivial decisions, such as generating additional tests for a problem. In many cases, the initial tests generated by the model may contain errors.\n\nTo incorporate this concept into the system, AlphaCodium introduces an extra step of validation. After the model generates an output, such as a set of tests, it is then asked to re-generate the same output but with a focus on correcting any errors that may exist. For example, if the model has generated a set of AI tests, it is then tasked with re-generating these tests while fixing any incorrect outputs. This step encourages the model to critically evaluate its initial output and apply reasoning to correct mistakes.\n\nThis approach is found to be more effective than simply asking the model a direct yes/no question about the correctness of the tests. By asking the model to re-generate and correct the output, it engages in a more thorough review process, which leads to higher quality results and fewer errors.\n\nThe soft decision with double validation is part of a broader strategy in AlphaCodium to improve code generation by avoiding direct questions that can lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers, and instead fostering a more exploratory and iterative approach to problem-solving.",

        "query": "In the AlphaCodium paper, why do they argue that YAML makes more sense than JSON for their task?",
        "gt_answer": "In the AlphaCodium paper, they argue that YAML output is better suited for code generation tasks than JSON output for several reasons:\n\n1. Code generated by large language models (LLMs) often contains single quotes, double quotes, special characters, etc. LLMs would struggle to correctly place these characters inside a JSON format because JSON output needs to be surrounded by initial double quotes, which can be problematic for such characters.\n\n2. YAML output with block scalars only needs to obey indentation rules. Any text or code with proper indentation will be a legal YAML output, which is not the case with JSON that requires additional formatting.\n\n3. YAML format does not require curly brackets, quotations, or escape characters, which means its output has fewer tokens than JSON. This reduction in tokens decreases cost and inference time and results in increased quality because the model needs to pay attention to fewer non-essential tokens.\n\nThese points suggest that YAML is more flexible and less error-prone when dealing with the complexities of code generation, making it a more suitable choice for the tasks described in the AlphaCodium paper.",

        "gt_answer": "The AlphaCodium paper presented detailed results comparing the performance of the AlphaCodium flow to other methods, both on various models and against previous works in the literature. Here are the detailed results as reported in the paper:\n\n1. **Direct Prompt vs. AlphaCodium Flow:**\n   - The paper used a metric called pass@k, which is the percentage of problems solved by using k generated solutions per problem.\n   - AlphaCodium flow consistently and significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CodeContests problems.\n   - This improvement was observed for both open-source (DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT) models, and for both validation and test sets.\n   - For GPT-4 on the validation set, the pass@5 score improved from 19% to 44%, which is a 2.3 times improvement.\n\n   Here's a breakdown of the results from Table 1 in the paper:\n\n   | Model      | Set        | Method        | Score (pass@5) |\n   |------------|------------|---------------|----------------|\n   | DeepSeek   | Validation | Direct Prompt | 7%             |\n   | DeepSeek   | Validation | AlphaCodium   | 20%            |\n   | DeepSeek   | Test       | Direct Prompt | 12%            |\n   | DeepSeek   | Test       | AlphaCodium   | 24%            |\n   | GPT-3.5    | Validation | Direct Prompt | 15%            |\n   | GPT-3.5    | Validation | AlphaCodium   | 25%            |\n   | GPT-3.5    | Test       | Direct Prompt | 8%             |\n   | GPT-3.5    | Test       | AlphaCodium   | 17%            |\n   | GPT-4      | Validation | Direct Prompt | 19%            |\n   | GPT-4      | Validation | AlphaCodium   | 44%            |\n   | GPT-4      | Test       | Direct Prompt | 12%            |\n   | GPT-4      | Test       | AlphaCodium   | 29%            |\n\n2. **Comparison to Previous Works:**\n   - AlphaCodium was compared to CodeChain and AlphaCode using the same model (GPT-3.5) and the same metric (pass@5), and it consistently performed better.\n   - AlphaCode used a different generation methodology, which involved fine-tuning a model specifically for code problems, generating a large number of code solutions, clustering them, and submitting solutions from the top clusters.\n   - Despite AlphaCode's brute-force-like approach with a significantly higher number of LLM calls, AlphaCodium achieved better top results.\n\n   Here's a summary of the results from Table 2 in the paper:\n\n   | Model    | Set        | Method         | Score            |\n   |----------|------------|----------------|------------------|\n   | GPT-3.5  | Validation | AlphaCodium    | 25%              |\n   | GPT-3.5  | Validation | CodeChain      | 17%              |\n   | GPT-3.5  | Test       | AlphaCodium    | 17%              |\n   | GPT-3.5  | Test       | CodeChain      | 14%              |\n   | GPT-4    | Validation | AlphaCodium    | 44%              |\n   | GPT-4    | Validation | AlphaCode      | 17% (pass@10@1K) |\n   | GPT-4    | Validation | AlphaCode      | 24% (pass@10@100K) |\n   | GPT-4    | Test       | AlphaCodium    | 29%              |\n   | GPT-4    | Test       | AlphaCode      | 16% (pass@10@1K) |\n   | GPT-4    | Test       | AlphaCode      | 28% (pass@10@100K) |\n\n3. **Computational Effort and Comparison to AlphaCode and AlphaCode2:**\n   - AlphaCodium performed approximately 15-20 LLM calls per solution, so a pass@5 submission involved around 100 LLM calls.\n   - AlphaCode's approach, assuming one call per run, involved 1 million LLM calls for a pass@10@100K, which is four orders of magnitude more than AlphaCodium.\n   - AlphaCode2, a newer work, claimed to be over 10,000 times more sample efficient than AlphaCode, requiring about 100 samples to reach the level of performance of AlphaCode with a million samples.\n   - AlphaCodium uses general-purpose models as-is and improves their performances without extra data and an expensive training phase, unlike AlphaCode2, which utilized a heavily fine-tuned model specifically for CodeContests competition.\n\nThe paper concluded that AlphaCodium, with its iterative approach and novel design concepts, significantly improves the performance of LLMs on challenging code generation tasks while being computationally efficient.",
